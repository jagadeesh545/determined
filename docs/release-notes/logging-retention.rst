**New Features**

-  Logging: Log retention can now be configured in the server config through the `logging_retention`
   section, with optional `days` and `schedule` entries. Experiments can override the server
   provided default by setting `log_retention_days` in the experiment config. Values of `-1` to
   `32767` are valid for retention days, and schedules must be a valid cron expression or duration.
   If retention days is set to `-1`, logs will be retained indefinitely. If retention days is set to
   `0`, logs will will be deleted on the next scheduled log cleanup. Log retention cleanup can be
   run manually by admins with the `det master cleanup-logs` command.
